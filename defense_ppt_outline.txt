1. This paper focus on OpenFlow network(like DCN)
Problem: Server link Status, typical SNMP monitoring quary using round robin.
When something really bad happens, there is SNMP trap can help
However, in network, there is nothing as convinent as SNMP monitor.
And, what we used to determine weather a host/server is in the network is
using ping/tracerout(tracert in win). It seems there is nothing can tell us
what is wrong in real time.

1.1 So, What should we do?
My paper does this and that.
[things in paper]
[demo]


2. DHCP is just one example, showing that OpenFlow controller can do more.
Say, if one DCN uses static IP allocation method. To do the same thing as my paper presents, one just need to change the DHCP code into analysis of other protocol(s). Or, I can make it different module to fit in different network management model. 

3. What should I prepare?
   a.How DHCP works
